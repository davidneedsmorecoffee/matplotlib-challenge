# matplotlib for pharmaceutical data analysis / visualization

#### The sample data set is based on 250 mice treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. 
- The physiological responses of the mice were monitored over the course of the treatment. 

#### The goal of the analysis is to evaluate how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

- `Pandas Library`, `Matplotlib library`, and `Jupyter Notebook` were used.


#### Several plots were constructed as part of the report:
- scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
- scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
- scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
- bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
